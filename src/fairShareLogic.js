/*A flow group has a name, an estimated demand, an (arbitrary) display color,
and, most importantly, the bandwidth requirements for each allocation level:
For each allocation level, there is a list of weight thresholds.
Each weight threshold is a pair of values [bandwidth, weight].
* If the flow group requires no bandwidth in an allocation level, there should be a single pair [0,0].
* Otherwise, it should contain 1+ pairs where:
-- bandwidth values (meaning cumulative bandwidth for that allocation level) must be increasing
-- weight values must be decreasing
In addition, the last requirement for the last (least prioritary) allocation level
should be infinite, since the estimated demand of the flow group is what should
ultimately limit how much bandwidth can be allocated to a flow group.

The bandwidth requested for each allocation level must be completely allocatable
by the point fair share reaches the transition to the next allocation level.
For now, the slope of bandwidth functions is equal to the weight, so a bandwidth
function could be invalid if the required bandwidth is too high (equivalently, if the weight is too low)
For example, 2.5 bandwidth with weight 1 would be too much for an allocation level with a range of 0-2 fair share.
(the alternative would be to make the slope a multiple of the weight that changes automatically
but, for the sake of visualization, I think weight=slope is more useful)
